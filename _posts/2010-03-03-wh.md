# Python


Inserting or deleting from beginning of list is costly  as all elements need to be shifted

Can be costly when removing or inserting at the end if preallocated memory becomes full. 

Code

```python
    list = [1, 2, 3, "Text", 1.2]
```

Output

```python
[1, 2, 3, 'Text', 1.2]
```

### Negative Indexing

This lets you index from the back of the list

```python
print(List[-1])
```

```python
print(List[-3])
```

# Tuple

These are similar to lists but they are immutable.

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ Immutable - Once created, it cannot be changed.

</aside>

Code

```python
Tuple = ('Geeks', 'For')
```

Output

```python
('Geeks', 'For')
```

To create a Tuple with one element, you must include the trailing â€˜,â€™. 

e.g

```python
Tuple = (8,)
```

It can be indexed exactly like a list. This includes negative indexing.

# Sets

Sets do not allow repeat values. They are mutable and perform insertion, deletion and traversal at O(1) on average. If more than one value is assigned to an index, it links together to form a linked list. In python, sets are created using dictionaries using dummy variables.

Code

```python
Set = set([1, 9, 'Hello', 4, 'Test', 2, 'Word'])

#accessing data using a for loop
for i in Set:
    print(i, end =" ")

#checking if element exists in set

print("Hello" in Set)
```

Output

```python
1, 2, 4, 'Hello', 'Test', 'Word'

True

```
